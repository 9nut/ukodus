# ukodus
Sudoku solver in Go

I wrote this because I was spending too much time on Sudoku puzzles.
I reasoned that if I wrote a solver, I would stop being compelled to
solved them by hand, since the solution requires the application of the
same finite set of strategies.

## build

`go build`

## usage

`./ukodus [-d] puzzle [puzzle...]`

e.g.

`./ukodus boards/s16.txt`
